	abstract = {The advent of ?social media? has enabled millions of people to participate in discussions within communities on a global scale. These conversations take place in a myriad of venues, on or off the web, each with its particular approach to implement what we now call ?social media? ? blogs, bulletin boards, mailing lists. However, while the software powering these communities varies a great deal, and continues to evolve, all of them share a common set of features. When a user initiates a discussion, the message is not addressed to a specific person, but broadcast to any interested reader; such a message can generate replies from other users, and these replies can then generate their own, forming a network of connections between messages. There is a need for a system that can make connections between related pieces of social text, to group information into coherent units. Making use of the structure of the social text helps to determine which elements of the text to consider for a given topic. To do this, a system needs to consider the different contexts in which it can be understood. A post, text transmitted by a single author at the same point in time, may have a different topic than the whole thread, which is comprised of all the posts in the discussion following an initial post. Different passages in a post could also have separate topics. Therefore, it is useful to annotate the text with information about its social structure explicitly for use in automatic search and text mining.}

"Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) is a body of research and an evaluation
paradigm that addresses event-based organization of broadcast news."
"TDT research begins with a constantly arriving stream of text from newswire
and from automatic speech-to-text systems [...]. Roughly speaking, the goal of
TDT is to break the text down into individual news stories, to monitor the
stories for events that have not been seen before, and to gather the stories
into groups that each discuss a single news topic."
"Within TDT, a topic is defined to be a set of news stories that are strongly
related by some seminal real-world event. [...] An intuitive definition of a
topic comes out of how people think about news reporting."
"[...] although it is similar in spirit to information filtering and retrieval
work done in the past, it is more tightly defined than broad notions of
"aboutness" and as a result admits the possibility of applying deeper automated
analysis of content to solve the problem. That is, it is interesting partly
because there is hope that some language technologies will be fruitful in this
domain even though they are not helpful for information retrieval in general."
Defines folllowing tasks:
- Story Segmentation (dividing transcript into individual stories)
- First Story Detection (recognizing the onset of a new topic in the stream)
- Cluster Detection (grouping stories as they arrive based on the topics)
- Tracking (monitoring the stream to find additional stories on a topic.)
- Story Link Detection (deciding whether two random stories discuss the same topic)

Uses a very simple statistical model, using named entities and noun phrases as
features and chi squared test to determine their statistical significance.
Feature time spans is defined by a span of days for which features are found
to be statistically significant. Important stories are generated by finding
features with overlapping time spans and merging features which are
statistically dependent in terms of document occurence.
Several issues are brought up:
- Stories with long time spans are split up if the topic drops for a single day;
- If the focus of a story drifts, the system will tend to split the story;
- NPs are often uninformative and spurious features, suggests to look into using
  subsumption hierarchies.
Evaluation shows poor results but this work is preliminary.
